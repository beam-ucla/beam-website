## What is BEAM? What does BEAM do?

BEAM (Building Engineers and Mentors) brings hands-on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) activities to underserved K-8 schools across Los Angeles. Our program aims to improve student attitudes toward STEM. Every week, we visit classes after school to perform experiments and give lessons covering various topics like biology, chemistry, or physics. Our members represent a variety of majors, from biology to computer science to English.

If BEAM sounds like a club that interests you, [fill out this form]({{site.interest_form}}) and come to one of our weekly meetings!

## How do I join?

You can fill out our [interest form]({{site.interest_form}}) to receive email updates. If you can't make it to our first meeting of the quarter, drop by any Monday at 6pm (same link as above); we're happy to get new members any time, and we don't have a formal application. Email us at [uclabeam@ucla.edu](mailto:uclabeam@ucla.edu) if you have any questions!
