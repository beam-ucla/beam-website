### Info For LAUSD Schools:

If you'd like BEAM to offer lessons at your school, shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:uclabeam@ucla.edu">uclabeam@ucla.edu</a>! We're looking to expand to more Title I schools in the 2020-2021 school year. Our current curriculum is tailored to 4th- and 5th-grade science standards but we're open to working with other grade levels as well.

While you're here on your site, check out our [lesson plans]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/lessons.html)!

Also, check out our [YouTube channel]({{site.socials.YouTube}}), where we will be periodically adding new content!
