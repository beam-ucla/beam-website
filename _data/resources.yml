- name: "Crash Course Kids"
  link: "https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcoursekids/videos"
  blurb: "Counterpart to CrashCourse for a younger audience. These videos mostly focus on simpler STEM concepts. Some provide explanations while others are more about having fun with science. They’d make a great supplement to our lessons."

- name: "Crash Course"
  link: "https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse/videos"
  blurb: " Probably one of our favorite educational YouTube channels! They make fun and engaging videos that cover all topics from history to science to math. Many of the concepts are more advanced than elementary school level (many cover high school and even college concepts), but they do a great job explaining things."

- name: "Google AI Experiments"
  link: "https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/ai"
  blurb: "The drawing ones are especially good for the kids, and we could provide a brief explanation of how they work (provide a VERY large dataset to the computer as reference images so it can recognize the features of an image/drawing like the curve on the bottom of a boat drawing or the long trunk of a tree). They’re games, so really for any age in elementary school."

- name: "Epicurious 4 Levels of Cooking"
  link: "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz3-p2q6vFYUDvVUu_aPhGUV-3ROIa6d2"
  blurb: "They show the process of cooking a dish between chefs of three levels (Amateur, Home Cook, Professional Chef who specializes in the dish). For now they feature simple and fundamental recipes (fried rice, spaghetti, pancakes, omelets, cookies) and you get to see how the chefs at each level approach a recipe. At the end, the Level 4 (a food scientist) takes over and deconstructs what each chef has done, and the effect it has on their dish. This one might be more for middle school and up, but they get to learn how to cook and the science behind cooking."

  link: "https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt"
  blurb: "Their relatively short (usually 10 min and under) animated videos tackle anything from (but not limited to) space, climate change, biology, technology, and philosophy. The animation is pretty unique and very well-done, and the storytelling is engaging."

- name: "TED-Ed"
  link: "https://www.youtube.com/user/TEDEducation"
  blurb: " Animated lessons for a broad range of audience and on topics across STEM and humanities, including philosophy, media literacy, literature, nutrition, math in real life, art and climate. Some topics are targeted towards higher grade levels, but overall I think all of them are widely accessible and enjoyable across the age spectrum (K-12 to elderly)."
