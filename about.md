## About BEAM

BEAM (Building Engineers and Mentors) brings hands-on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) activities to underserved K-8 schools across Los Angeles. Our program aims to improve student attitudes toward STEM.  Every week, we visit classes after school to perform experiments and give lessons covering various topics like biology, chemistry, or physics. Our members represent a variety of majors, from engineering to computer science to English. If BEAM sounds like a club that interests you, we encourage you to visit one of our weekly meetings!

## Meeting Times

We hold meetings every Tuesday at 6:00 pm in Boelter 7702. We encourage anyone interested in joining to come to a meeting!

## Site Visits

Every Thursday and Friday we travel from campus to a local elementary school to give a lesson plan for students from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm. Current participating schools are [Melrose Elementary School](https://melrose-lausd-ca.schoolloop.com/) and [Crescent Heights Elementary School](https://crescentheightsmagnet-lausd-ca.schoolloop.com/).
