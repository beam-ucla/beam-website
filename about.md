## What is BEAM? What does BEAM do?

BEAM (Building Engineers and Mentors) brings hands-on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) activities to underserved K-8 schools across Los Angeles. Our program aims to improve student attitudes toward STEM.  Every week, we visit classes after school to perform experiments and give lessons covering various topics like biology, chemistry, or physics. Our members represent a variety of majors, from engineering to computer science to English. If BEAM sounds like a club that interests you, we encourage you to visit one of our weekly meetings!

## I'm not an engineering majorâ€¦can I still join BEAM?
Yes! BEAM is open to all majors. All the material we teach is geared towards 4th and 5th graders, and we go over each week's lesson before teaching it, so don't worry about being a science genius.

## How do I join?
Come out to our Tuesday night meetings at 6pm in Boelter 7702! No application necessary, and we accept new members year round. You can also shoot us an email at [uclabeam@ucla.edu](mailto:uclabeam@ucla.edu).

## When/where do you meet?
We have weekly curriculum meetings Tuesdays at 6pm in Boelter 7702. Every Thursday and Friday we travel from campus to a local elementary school to give a lesson plan for students from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm. Current participating schools are [Melrose Elementary School](https://melrose-lausd-ca.schoolloop.com/) and [Crescent Heights Elementary School](https://crescentheightsmagnet-lausd-ca.schoolloop.com/).

## How much of a time commitment is BEAM?
We have 1-hour curriculum meetings each week and two separate 3-hour site visits (members usually choose one site visit that works with their schedule). However, we understand that students are busy! If you need to miss meetings occasionally, we totally understand. If you can't make the Thursday or Friday site visits for a quarter, we still encourage you to come to curriculum meetings and stay involved!

## Do I need to transport myself to site visits?
Nope! We rent cars through UCLA and one of our members with a license drives everyone to site visits.

## Why should I join BEAM?
If you like working with kids, enjoy science, and want to meet some awesome new people then this is the club for you! Being involved with BEAM is a great way to give back to the LA community and mentor the next generation of scientists and engineers. We have fun seeing our students at site every week, and we host socials every quarter to foster community within our club.
