<!-- BEAM at UCLA. Bringing STEM to elementary schools (because science is awesome!) -->

Every week, we visit classes after school to perform experiments and give lessons covering various topics like biology, chemistry, or physics. Our hands-on activities include bridge building, making slime, programming robots, and blasting off stomp rockets!
